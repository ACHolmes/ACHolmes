## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a student at Harvard University majoring in Computer Science, and on track to complete minors in Physics and Spanish too. Here I'll share some of my CS projects :)

## Junior Year
-> <b>Chat application</b>: I built a chat application using gRPC and sockets for a project in CS262: Distributed Systems.

-> <b>[CS124 Algorithms & Data Structures teaching materials](https://github.com/ACHolmes/CS124-TF-S23)</b>: I am a Teaching Fellow for CS124 and this repo stores some of the materials I made for the class.

-> <b>[CS50 Intro to Computer Science teaching materials](https://github.com/ACHolmes/CS50TF-2022F) </b>: I was a TF for CS50 in the Fall, and this repo stores all my lab slides and other materials I made for the class.

-> <b>[CS61 Kernel PSET](https://github.com/ACHolmes/CS61-kernel) </b>: this is my implementation for the kernel PSET for CS61 for Fall 2022. (NOTE: this will only be public during Spring semester to ensure no future students are tempted to use my code in the future)

## Sophomore Year
-> Coming soon

## Freshman Year
-> Coming soon
