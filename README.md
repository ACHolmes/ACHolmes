## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a student at Harvard University majoring in Computer Science, and on track to complete minors in Physics and Spanish too. I'm currently working as a Software Engineer Intern at CS50's Research & Development Team, where we are working on numerous projects to enhance student's learning experience in Computer Science (and in other fields), notably by working on AI-assisted learning tools. You can see some of my work in action at [cs50.ai](https://cs50.ai/) and in the [CS50 Duck Debugger VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CS50.ddb50)! 

Below you'll find some of my projects, including a mix of homework assignements I enjoyed, final projects, teaching materials that I created for my teaching positions and other projects I've taken on for fun :)

## Junior Year
-> <b>[Distributed File System](https://github.com/ACHolmes/distributed-file-system)</b>: I built a distributed file system (in the spirit of OneDrive, without the nice (well, better) UI) in python using gRPC and watchdog for a project in CS262: Distributed Systems.

-> <b>[Liquid Democracy and Perceptional Competence](https://github.com/ACHolmes/distributed-file-system](https://github.com/ACHolmes/perceptional-competence)</b>: Myself, Patrick Thornton and Lauren Cooke (all Harvard '24) wrote this research paper on our proposal for a new model based around conventional Liquid Democracy models, introducing the idea of meta-competency and an evaluation mechanism for voters to perceive others' competence (rather than the conventional oracle call knowledge).

-> <b>[CS124 Algorithms & Data Structures teaching materials](https://github.com/ACHolmes/CS124-TF-S23)</b>: I am a Teaching Fellow for CS124 and this repo stores some of the materials I made for the class.

-> <b>[CS50 Intro to Computer Science teaching materials](https://github.com/ACHolmes/CS50TF-2022F) </b>: I was a TF for CS50 in the Fall, and this repo stores all my lab slides and other materials I made for the class.

-> <b>[CS61 Kernel PSET](https://github.com/ACHolmes/CS61-kernel) </b>: this is my implementation for the kernel PSET for CS61 for Fall 2022. (NOTE: this will only be public during Spring semester to ensure no future students are tempted to use my code in the future)

## Sophomore Year
-> Coming soon

## Freshman Year
-> Coming soon
