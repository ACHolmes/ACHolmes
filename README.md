## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a student at Harvard University majoring in Computer Science, and I will soon be working in San Francisco as a Codepoint Fellow for [Sutter Hill Ventures](https://shv.com/), with my two rotations for the first year at [Luminary Cloud](https://www.luminarycloud.com/) and [Observe Inc](https://www.observeinc.com/). Recently, I currently working as a Software Engineer Intern at CS50's Research & Development Team, where we are working on  projects to enhance student's learning experience in Computer Science (and in other fields), notably by working on AI-assisted learning tools. In addition, in January 2024, I worked on a soon-to-be-revealed project to help Harvard Students in a very different way. You can see some of my work in action at [cs50.ai](https://cs50.ai/) and in the [CS50 Duck Debugger VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CS50.ddb50), and [read the paper we wrote about the project here](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/publications/V1fp0567-liu.pdf)!

Last semester, I was one of the Head Teaching Fellows for CS50, and taught the most comfortable section for the course. You can find the [teaching materials I made here](https://github.com/ACHolmes/cs50_tf_f23), some of my student's final projects [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWCk8wdvXPA) and {TBA when I get the chance to ask them for permission to share here}. You can find the seminar I taught on setting up local development for CS50 students [here](https://youtu.be/vQd_fxzCIs0?si=mLFVp9nhtWm6xXuC). I also challenge you to beat my Speller PSET submission time that you can [find here](https://speller.cs50.net/cs50/problems/2023/fall/challenges/speller), which I messed around to knock my students off the top spot one weekend and believe is currently the second fastest ever with the current set of tests :)

Below you'll find some of my projects, including a mix of homework assignements I enjoyed, final projects, teaching materials that I created for my teaching positions and other projects I've taken on for fun :)

## Senior Year
-> <b> Column-store database (link available on request to ensure not used by future CS165 students)</b>: for CS165 (Data Systems), the project is to build a column-store database from Scratch in C. It is capable of performing select, fetch, print, vector operations such as add and subtract, fold operations such as average and sum, query batching and multithreaded query processing, creation of sorted and b-tree indices, and naive loop and hash joins. My code I believe is somewhere around 6-8k lines of C code. 

## Junior Year
-> <b>[Distributed File System](https://github.com/ACHolmes/distributed-file-system)</b>: I built a distributed file system (in the spirit of OneDrive, without the nice (well, better) UI) in python using gRPC and watchdog for a project in CS262: Distributed Systems.

-> <b>[Liquid Democracy and Perceptional Competence](https://github.com/ACHolmes/perceptional-competence)</b>: Myself, Patrick Thornton and Lauren Cooke (all Harvard '24) wrote this research paper on our proposal for a new model based around conventional Liquid Democracy models, introducing the idea of meta-competency and an evaluation mechanism for voters to perceive others' competence (rather than the conventional oracle call knowledge).

-> <b>[CS124 Algorithms & Data Structures teaching materials](https://github.com/ACHolmes/CS124-TF-S23)</b>: I am a Teaching Fellow for CS124 and this repo stores some of the materials I made for the class.

-> <b>[CS50 Intro to Computer Science teaching materials](https://github.com/ACHolmes/CS50TF-2022F) </b>: I was a TF for CS50 in the Fall, and this repo stores all my lab slides and other materials I made for the class. NOTE: The link earlier gives my teaching materials for when I taught in 2023, and they are significantly improved.

## Sophomore Year
-> TBA

## Freshman Year
-> TBA
